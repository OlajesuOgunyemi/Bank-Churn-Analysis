 ### Project Objectives: 

This project helps the bank to identify patterns, understand the key factor behind why customers leave a retail bank(churn), and provide targeted, actionable recommendation to reduce customer attrition and improve retention 

 ### Dataset Description
 
 **-Source**: Bank Churn dataset (10,000 records), commonly used in industry case studies [Maven analytics website](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&search=bank%20churn)

 -**Key Features** 

        . Customer Id, Gender, Age, Geography 

        . Credit Score, Balance, Tenure, No of Product 

        . HasCrCard, Active Member, Estimated Salary, Existed Members 

         

  ### Project Analytical Question Answered

**1**  Which attribute (demographic or behavioral) are more common among churners vs Non churner

 **2** What does the overall demographic profile of bank churners look like 

**3** Are there difference in account behavior based on geography? (e.g.. Churn rate by region) 

**4** What segment exist within the bank customer base, like age and credit score grouping and how did they how do they influence churn

 ### KEY INSIGHTS

**.Higher churn rate** :among customers aged 46-55  56-65 

**.Geographical Matters** : Certain countries (e.g Germany) showed higher churn rate 

**.Credit Score and Product Count** : Medium Credit Score combined with fewer bank product indicated a higher risk of churn 

**.Tenure** : Newer customer (less than 6 month) showed higher attrition 

### RECOMMENDATION

**. Promote Product Bundling** : Encourage low product users to explore additional services 

**. Tailored Communication** : Customized offers and messaging based on customer profile 

**. Re-engagement Campaign** : For inactive members, incentivize activity to reduce churn risk 

**. Investigation** : Investigate the reason for lower churn in other geography (France, Spain) in order to increase the account behavior in the geography (country) 

**.Monitor and Re-evaluate** : Continue tracking churn metric monthly/quarterly after intervention 

**. Country Specific Initiative** : Focus retension effort where churn is highest
